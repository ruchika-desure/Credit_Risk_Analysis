# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Problem Statement

**The companies providing loan find it difficult to give loans to the people having insufficient credit history. Due to this, some consumers use it to their advantage by becoming a defaulter. Therefore, a Credit Risk Analysis will help the consumer finance company to take a decision of approving or rejecting a loan application based on the applicantâ€™s profile. Thus, the company can then avoid financial loss.**
